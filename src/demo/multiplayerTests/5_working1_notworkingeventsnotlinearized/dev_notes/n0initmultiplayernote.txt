I just got multiplayer working but have a few problems:

- the initial state is not synced, so one player creates their caret before the other player even joins.
  - sol 1: store state on the server and send it to clients when they join
  - [x] sol 2: one client is the host and other clients can request state from them
  - note: its interesting that the state isn't synced! You only share the parts of the document that you'readonly
    there for and it works! Maybe could come back to this idea.

- selections are not visible. This would require registering carets as anchors to other carets.
  - [x] sol 1: create an object that represents a caret and its object. Make it so that you can only create this, not raw carets.

- there is artificial lag I added so that messages would not be sent before the WSChannel is open.
  - sol 1: add a buffer to the channel.
  - [x] sol 2: restructure app so stuff doesn't happen until channel is connected.

- history has been disabled because I'm not sure how to handle apiUndel yet.
  - note: the reason I don't know what to do is because currently other clients do not keep track
    of caretSinks that you delete, only you keep track of them. Is that okay? Is undel just ins for
    other clients? How do we know where to ins? How do we not mix up refs? (current serialization should work)
  - [x] sol 1: find closest non-deleted caretSink to the left of the deleted one and insert after that
