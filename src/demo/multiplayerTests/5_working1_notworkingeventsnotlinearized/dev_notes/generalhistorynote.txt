I keep wondering how this idea of history can extend to arbitrary editors.
I picture an apocalypse chess board or a bezier curve editor or a draggable
rubik's cube. It seems that there are some operations that overwrite (drag bezier curve handle),
some that add new data (add text in text editor), some that delete data (remove text), and some that transform data
(commute in a math editor).
Is there a way so that people can add these operations to their editors without
having to think about implementing history for them? Are there other sorts
of operations that I'm not considering?
