// TODO monday:
// 1. adapt https://codepen.io/vez/pen/WNaWwEP to linked lists instead of just clocks (clocks replaced with ll index)
//   - place these events in a linked list for each id
//   - implement something that gets the ll index to the event in a linked list
//   - adapt linearizing / sorting to use the ll index
//   - adapt all references / serializations to be ll indices
// 2. adapt linked lists to trees instead (ll index replaced with tree path)
//   - trees are linearized into a linked list to the head, then existing strategy is applied for linearization of events from all ids and reducing
//   - undo and redo ammounts to "change head" commands
//   - branching is just an action (or maybe a different field) that says what event (with the same creator id) it is after
//     - trees are constructed based on this
//     - clients will probably always move head to the latest created action
// 3. clean up, test, and start applying to action based text editing with carets and all.
//  - note: vanity caret positions (caret movements not associated to an action) will be sent over a separate channel.

// TODO ELSEWHERE (just writing all my end of friday notes here):
// - nested editing (inserting nested text editors)
// - drag and drop (nesting)
//   - vanity mouse position sharing
// - mild perf optimization for spatial editing if necessary
// - bug aria about sponsorship
// - visual notes on the tree based multiplayer once it is working

// aside:
// - we need to separate the events by id because of the tie breaking algorithm (id alphetical)
//   and in the future of ownership for undoing and redoing.
// - don't need guuids because we might as well handled name collisions anyway??? idk maybe wack
