<p>
  This is an interactive note about a little language that is about calling
  functions on both the right side (like usual) and the left side of `=`. Scroll
  down to the interactive code editor below if you just want to try it out. The
  language is inspired by destructuring, or pattern matching.
</p>
Pattern Matching in Agda / Haskell:
<pre>
head (x :: xs) = x 
tail (x :: xs) = xs</pre
>
Destructuring in JavaScript:
<pre>
const head = ([x,..._]) => x
const tail = ([_,...rest]) => rest
</pre>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
  I think I first started thinking about this little language when I was
  learning Agda during
  <a
    href="https://www.uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottest_summer_school_2022.html"
    >HoTTest Summer School</a
  >. In Agda, I learned how to define isomorphisms.
</p>
<p>
  An isomorphism is a function with an opposite: you can give it an input and
  get an output, but then you can also give it an output and get back the same
  input.
</p>
<img src="iso_example.svg" />
<p>
  In functional languages, data constructors are functions that have opposites!
  You give a constructor an input, and you get out a data structure as output.
  With a data structure, you can get back all the inputs used to construct it.
  Here's an example of some code to get back all the inputs used to construct an
  object in JavaScript (of course you can also destrcucture objects in JS, but
  I'm trying to illustrate that you can write code to do this without fancy
  destructuring syntax)
</p>
<pre>
const exampleObject = { propertyName1: 'hello', propertyName2: 'goodbye'};
const inputs = Object.entries(exampleObject)
// [['propertyName1', 'hello'], ['propertyName2', 'goodbye']]
</pre>
<p>
  This is pretty much the reason that pattern matching and destructuring works!
  The only way to make data structures is with constructors, and constructors
  have opposites, so you can destructure or pattern match data using
  constructors!
</p>
<pre>
  // constructor
  const a = [1,2,3]
  // constructor opposite
  const [x,y,z] = a
</pre>
<p>
  Pattern matching using constructors is great!.. But in all but the most
  primitive cases, things can be decomposed in multiple ways. Here's two
  illustrations of what I mean:
</p>
<img src="reps.svg" />
<p>
  In the first row in the illustration above, we have two ways of decomposing
  any 2D vector: first into cartesian coordinates, and second into polar
  coordinates. Usually when programming, we construct our 2D vector data one of
  these two ways, so we can only pattern match on the way we constructed the
  data.
</p>
<p>
  In the second row, we have multiple ways of writing any number. Numbers can't
  be destructured in JavaScript, but they can be pattern matched in Agda, like
  in this definition of `+`:
</p>
<pre>
data Number : Set where
0 : Number
successor  : Number → Number

_            + _ : Number -> Number -> Number
0            + y = y
successor(x) + y = successor(x + y)
</pre>
<p>
  But there's lots of other ways of writing numbers, so why can't we pattern
  match them in other ways? For some other examples, we can write any number as
  a sum of two other numbers, or as a product or exponential. Once again, why
  can't we pattern match against these other ways of writing numbers?
</p>
<h2>How to code in this language</h2>
<p>
  Okay, so I've tried to write down my thoughts around this mini-language up to
  this point. Now, let me just talk about what it is. The language has a few
  built-in functions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>+</li>
  <li>*</li>
  <li>**</li>
  <li>array</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each of these functions can be used on the left or the right side of the `=`.
  The grammar is very roughly:
</p>
<pre>
  program ::= [line][program] | [endOfInput]
  line ::= const [funcCall] | [positiveInteger] | [varName] = [funcCall] | [positiveInteger] | [varName]
</pre>
<p>
  In each line, only one variable that does not have a value is allowed to
  occur, unless you are destructuring an array. Each entry of an array may have
  one variable without a value. Although it may look like one, this language is
  not a relational language (like e.g. miniKanren). It can't find solutions from
  constraints. It is actually just a convenient syntax for calling functions
  forward and backward.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, please try it out! Let me know your thoughts in the comments below or
  on <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@vez">mastodon</a> or
  <a href="https://twitter.com/elliotokay">X (formerly twitter)</a>.

<h2>Demo</h2>
<div
  id="container"
  style="
    margin: 20px 0;
    border-radius: 15px;
    height: 200px;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 15px;
    background: white;
    overflow: hidden;
  "
></div>
<div
  id="result"
  style="
    margin: 20px 0;
    border-radius: 15px;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 15px;
    background: white;
    font-family: 'fira code';
  "
></div>

<h2>How its evaluated:</h2>
<p>
  +, *, **, array all currently have definitions per "missing" argument or
  output (e.g. one definition for each of +(a,2)=2, +(2,a)=2, +(2,2)=a). In
  contrast to relational languages where there is one definition that works in
  all these cases.
</p>
<p>
  To figure out the value of a variable, the syntax tree is traversed, starting
  at that variable's node, and the values are filled in using the definitions
  mentioned above. You can see the (very rough) code
  <a
    href="https://github.com/vezwork/polylab/blob/main/src/demo/bidirectionalParse/customMiniLang.ts"
    >here</a
  >. Here's an illustration of a traversal:
</p>

<h2>Future Work</h2>
<h3>User-defined functions</h3>
<p>
  Right now, programs are evaluated forwards and backwards. If you write your
  program carefully, the entire thing will be an isomorphism. This means that we
  can let the user define their own bidirectional functions just by writing some
  lines of code in the body like normal coding. Not all functions written this
  way would be bidirectional, but its easy to check if they are just by looking
  at which variables depend on which variables in the body of a function.
</p>
<h3>Blending with relational programming</h3>
<p>
  We can add a definition to functions for when too many arguments / results are
  missing for there to be a single answer. For example
</p>
<pre>
const +(a,b) = 3
</pre>
<p>
  could give an iterable which gives all pairs of `a`s and `b`s that add to 3.
  It could also give a dependency graph: a = 3-b, b = 3-a so that a and b can be
  filled in later.
</p>
<p>
  Definitions could also be added for when multiple arguments are actually the
  same variable.
</p>
<p>
  Although this seems tedious, it results in programs that run much faster than
  relational programs, but can be written in a similar way. Don't get me wrong,
  relational languages are way more expressive, but I think this could be nice
  syntax to have for non-relational languages.
