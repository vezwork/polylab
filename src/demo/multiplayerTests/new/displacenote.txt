When carethosts are deleted, all carets pointing to them have to move.
But what happens if you un-delete a caret host? The caret hosts that
were pointing to it should return. There's some ways to think about this:

1. carets can secretly point at deleted things but look like they are pointing to the closest thing on the left to the deleted thing
```
export const getNotDeletedHostToLeft = (c: CaretHost) => {
    for (const host of leftOf(c)) {
        if (!host.deleted) return hosts
    }
};
```
  - Does this mean carethosts have bounds when deleted?
    - could define this to be the bounds of the carethost if it lived in a world where it was undeleted
      - seems a bit wack if someone else inserts stuff
        - nvm, there is just two possibilities: one where content is inserted before deleted things and one where it is inserted after.
          currently content is inserted before deleted things.
2. history keeps track of which carets were moved
  - what if someone else moves the caret? 

3. displacement tracking (seems incomplete because it can only move back to a specific place, not a sequence of places)
```
export type Caret = {
  at: CaretHost;
  displacedFrom: CaretHost | null; // a deleted CaretHost
  readonly color: string;
};
```
 - Or does it mean that carets keep track of where they were displaced from and know how to update their position when carethosts are undeleted?
