This is the place where I got Algae working. 
I wanted to preserve this form of it so I don't plan to make further changes here.
This version of Algae is mostly based around creating layouts, not editing them
(although a bit of direct manipulation came for free!). The best example of this version
is in `./test_dag_and_sum.js`.
