<h2>Why I'm writing this</h2>
<p>I want to share my thoughts about what I am looking for in my next job.</p>
<p>
  I'm writing this because I want to learn how to clearly represent my needs and
  wants when it comes to work.
</p>
<h2>In 2023 I reflected and worked on projects</h2>
<p>
  Over the past year I took a career break. I tried to figure out a bit about
  what I want from my career in that time. I also worked on
  <a href="../2023/projects.html">a lot of projects</a>.
</p>
<p>
  There are many things I want to explore and learn about through my projects
  (mostly programming interaction stuff). I've connected with lot of interesting
  and lovely people online through my explorations. My projects are important to
  me.
</p>
<h2>Job motivation</h2>
<p>
  In the past I've had various motivations for taking the jobs I've taken.
  Largely I've been motivated by interest in the technical aspects of the work.
  I still really care about the technical side of things, but now I want to
  reflect and find a more balanced view of what I want and need based on what
  I've experienced.
</p>
<h2>Two main things I'm looking for</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong
      >I want to work at a place that understands the value of side projects and
      can accomodate me with time to work on them.</strong
    >
    I am looking for a place where I could work 4 days a week or where I could
    take month-long sabbaticals, alongside normal vacation.<br /><br />
    I worry that this won't sound reasonable to some people. I don't expect that
    I can convince anyone, but I'll just say: In the past, I have done my most
    effective work while having time for side projects. I learn applicable
    skills through my side projects, and am able to apply myself more deeply to
    both work and projects if I have time for both.<br />
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      >I want to work at a place where there is a strong culture of
      collaboration and communication.</strong
    >
    When I work alone, I work on side projects; At work, I want to be working
    with others! I want my place of work to have structures and tools in place
    that facillitate communication. I want to grow as a team member, community
    member, and as a communicator at work. The more
    <a href="https://cal.com/open">open</a> and community oriented the work is,
    the better!
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I think these are the most important things that I am looking for.</p>
<h2>Other important things</h2>
<p>
  <strong>diversity</strong><br />I value working with people from different
  backgrounds. I would like to work with people who share this value. I would
  love to work at a place that takes it upon itself to take action on diversity
  issues within our industry, such as the lack of representation of women in
  programming.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>money and benefits</strong><br />
  Money is not my main priority, the other points I've written about are more
  important. That being said, I would ask for a competitive salary with health
  benefits.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>learning about programming, interaction, and math</strong><br />I want
  to learn about math, computer science, programming interaction, creativity,
  online collaboration, and more. I want to learn about communication and
  visualization of topics in these areas. I would like my role and the people
  around me to support me in my interests! It would be awesome to work with
  people who I can share my passion with! You can find more out about my
  interests in <a href="../2023/projects.html">my 2023 projects note</a> or on
  <a href="https://elliot.website">elliot.website</a>.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  This is at a really high level and I could talk more about everything here;
  hopefully though this gives a picture of where I'm at and what I'm broadly
  looking for. Thank you for taking a look.
</p>
