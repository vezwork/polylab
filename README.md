## Polylab

My rough work and experiments for Polytope. This is almost completely undocumented and unpublicized for now.

There are demos you can view, for example: 

- [https://vezwork.github.io/polylab/dist/demo/greenBoxCaretNav/refactor2.html](https://vezwork.github.io/polylab/dist/demo/greenBoxCaretNav/refactor2.html)

You can look in the demos folder and modify this URL to view the other demos for now. You can also clone and `npm run watch` to get a file server to navigate the demos with. Sorry its a bit rough to explore!

## Building and running locally

1. Clone this repo to the folder of your choice.
2. Navigate to that folder in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run watch`.
5. Navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser (or maybe 8081 or 8082 or so on if you have other servers running)
